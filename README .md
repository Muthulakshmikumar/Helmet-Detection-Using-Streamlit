# Helmet Detection Using Streamlit

This is a beginner-friendly Computer Vision project that detects riders using a YOLO model and displays results using a Streamlit web application.

## Features
- Upload an image
- Detect objects using YOLO
- Display detection results
- Safety warning for helmet usage

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- YOLO (Ultralytics)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Note
This project uses a pre-trained YOLO model and does not include a custom helmet dataset.

## Future Enhancements
- Custom helmet detection model
- Real-time camera detection
- AI-based safety assistant
